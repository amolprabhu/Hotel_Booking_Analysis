## 📋 Summary

This project is aimed at performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a hotel bookings dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis is a key part of any machine learning project. Performing an EDA helps a Data Scientist understand the data in depth.
The data comprises of various columns such as types of hotels, countries, stays, average daily rate etc.

The data was first cleaned before analyzing it to find details. Data cleaning mainly comprised of null value handling.

The libraries that are used in this project are:
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
These libraries helped in data handling and visualization.
